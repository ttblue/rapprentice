Zrot -10 - (1 - old kp, 2,3,4 - new kp)
	1. Success.
	2. Failure at first pierce - a little off target.
	3. Faiulre at first piece - a little off target.
	4. Success.
	# Comments: This failed twice or so on the second attempt but I strongly believe it was incorrect kp selection.
	# 	    And the normal was off because of the sponge being uneven and weak at the hole.
	#	    When I moved the hole to be flat (better normal) and took care, it succeeded. Not sure how you want to view the failures.

	# Comments: first pierce is off-target by 1 cm or so but goes through for both cases - so success is slightly questionable.
